<h2>Exercise statement</h2>
Prove Proposition 2.3.5.

<strong>Proposition 2.3.5</strong> (Multiplication is associative)<strong>.</strong> For any natural numbers $latex a,b,c$, we have $latex (a\times b)\times c = a\times (b\times c)$.

<h2>How to think about the exercise</h2>
This is a straightforward exercise, so I don't have anything to say.
<h2>Model solution</h2>
We keep $latex b,c$ fixed and induct on $latex a$. For the base case, we have to show $latex (0\times b) \times c = 0\times (b\times c)$. The left hand side is $latex 0\times c=0$ and the right hand side is $latex 0$ so the two sides are equal.

Now suppose inductively that $latex (a\times b) \times c = a\times (b\times c)$. We want to show that $latex ((a{{+}\!{+}})\times b) \times c = (a{{+}\!{+}})\times (b\times c)$. Starting from the left hand side, $latex ((a{{+}\!{+}})\times b)\times c$ equals $latex (a\times b + b)\times c$ by the definition of multiplication, which equals $latex (a\times b)\times c + b\times c$ by the distributive law, which equals $latex a\times (b\times c) + b\times c$ by the inductive hypothesis, which equals $latex (a{{+}\!{+}})\times (b\times c)$ by the definition of multiplication. Thus, the two sides are equal, which closes the induction.
