<h2>Exercise statement</h2>
Prove Proposition 2.2.5.

<strong>Proposition 2.2.5</strong> (Addition is associative)<strong>.</strong> For any natural numbers $latex a,b,c$, we have $latex (a+b)+c = a + (b+c)$.

<ol>
 	<li>Fix two of the variables and induct on the third.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to think about the exercise</h2>
This is a simple induction exercise; it just tests your ability to write an induction proof and make use of the definition of addition. This sort of exercise requires no thinking (once you get the hang of things): at each step, you just do the next obvious thing.
<h2>Model solution</h2>
We shall fix $latex b,c$ and induct on $latex a$. For the base case, we want to show $latex (0+b)+c = 0 + (b+c)$. By definition of addition, $latex 0+b = b$, so $latex (0+b)+c = b+c$. Again by definition of addition, $latex 0 + (b+c) = b+c$. Thus, $latex (0+b)+c = 0 + (b+c)$ as required.

Now suppose inductively that $latex (a+b)+c = a + (b+c)$. We wish to show that $latex ((a{{+}\!{+}})+b)+c = (a{{+}\!{+}}) + (b+c)$. By definition of addition, $latex ((a{{+}\!{+}}) + b) + c = ((a + b){{+}\!{+}}) + c = ((a+b) + c){{+}\!{+}}$. Similarly, $latex (a{{+}\!{+}}) + (b+c) = (a + (b+c)){{+}\!{+}}$; by the inductive hypothesis, this is $latex ((a+b)+c){{+}\!{+}}$. In other words, both $latex ((a{{+}\!{+}}) + b)+c$ and $latex (a{{+}\!{+}}) + (b+c)$ are equal to $latex ((a+b)+c){{+}\!{+}}$. This closes the induction.
