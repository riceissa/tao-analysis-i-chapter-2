<h2>How to think about the exercise</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This exercise is basically just an application of all of the propositions and lemmas that appeared in this section (Section 2.3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exercises like this one test your ability to rigorously apply definitions and results. For each step, you want to cite the result which justifies it.</p>

<h2>Model solution</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let $latex a,b$ be natural numbers. By definition of exponentiation (Definition 2.3.11), $latex (a+b)^2 = (a+b)^1 \times (a+b) = (a+b)(a+b)$. By the distributive law (Proposition 2.3.4), we have $latex (a+b)(a+b) = (a+b)a + (a+b)b$. By the distributive law again, $latex (a+b)a = aa + ba$; by the definition of exponentiation and commutativity of multiplication (Lemma 2.3.2) this is just $latex a^2 + ab$. Similarly, by the distributive law, $latex (a+b)b = ab + bb = ab + b^2$. Summarizing everything so far, we have $latex (a+b)^2 = a^2 + ab + ab + b^2$. It now suffices to show that $latex ab + ab = 2ab$. By the associativity of multiplication and definition of multiplication, $latex 2ab = 2\times(ab) = (1\times (ab)) + ab = ab+ab$.</p>
